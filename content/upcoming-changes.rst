The Open Source Lab loves Beaver Barcamp, and we know the community does too.
The event plays an important role in fostering relationships between the tech
and academic communities, something the OSL wants to continue doing. However, we
see a need for more hands-on, workshop events. Given the tight academic
calendar, as well as the amount of organizing this event entails, the OSL has
chosen to substitute the fall Beaver BarCamp with a DevOps or Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS) Hackathon event.

“This year we decided that it was best to switch to a once a year format and
focus on making Beaver BarCamp better," says Lance Albertson, director of the
Open Source Lab. “We also look forward to developing new education programs such
as a Hackathon focused on DevOps and FOSS, getting students interested in it
early on in their school year. This would also enable us to kickstart DevOps
Bootcamp.”

The April 2014 Beaver BarCamp will continue as planned. The lab has decided to
call this Beaver BarCamp 14, aligning the number with the year. (And yes,
skipping unlucky number 13!)

At Beaver Barcamp 14, the Open Source Lab will offer a feedback session. We hope
you’ll join us in discussing how the lab can continue to support the open source
and academic communities at Oregon State.

Stay tuned for exciting details about our future events!
