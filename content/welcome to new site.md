Summary: An introduction to the new Beaver Barcamp website.

Historically, the OSU Open Source Lab used a Mediawiki website to coordinate Beaver Barcamp. After maintaining the site for roughly four years, we realized a few of Mediawiki's disadvantages. The main problems we encountered were **spambots**, and keeping pace with the **security patches**. Additionally, we didn't get many edits from the community. 

While we adore Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation, we decided that for Beaver Barcamp 11 a **static site generator** would be more appropriate. We built the site off of the [Pelican Static Site Generator][1]. We chose Pelican because it's supports Django templates, which are already used in the lab. To ease the development of the site, we used [Twitter Bootstrap][2].
