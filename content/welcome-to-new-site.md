Summary: An introduction to the new Beaver BarCamp website.

Welcome to the *new* website!

After many years of using MediaWiki and before that Drupal, we thought we would
try something different. We decided that a **static site generator** would be
more appropriate for our needs and built the site off of the [Pelican Static
Site Generator][1]. We chose Pelican because it supports Django templates,
which are already used in the lab. To ease the development of the site, we used
[Twitter Bootstrap][2].
