### New for Beaver BarCamp 12

As part of the Open Source Lab’s outreach program, we are planning some feature presentations: BarCamp 101, How to Tackle the Patent Process, How to Start-up your Start-up, How to Freelance for Magazines, and Something Cool about Bicycles.

This year we are also featuring sessions for high school students: Robotics, Tour the OSL, Open Source 101, Something Cool about Gaming, and something cool Timmel comes up with.

We will be posting updates @BeaverBarCamp. You can also connect on live chat via IRC — irc.freenode.net, #BeaverBarCamp. Sign-up for the Beaver BarCamp Mailing List to get important notifications about the event. 

## What is a BarCamp?

So do BarCamps involve beer? Well, no. [BarCamps are an international
phenomenon][4] where like-minded people gather to discuss a variety of topics.
Topics often focus more on the Web and open source technologies and other
DIY/hacker/open culture themes. Session topics can certainly be non-tech related
as well and we highly encourage it! 

## Who typically attends?

At BarCamp there are no specators, only paricipants! BarCamps are only as good
as the people who attend and share their ideas. Attendees are encouraged to demo
new ideas, hold a group discussion on a specific topic, explain a unique hobby
or just about anything else. Sometimes sessions even spawn other sessions
randomly!

We invite everyone and anyone in the community and at OSU to enjoy Beaver
Barcamp.

## Parking

You are free to park anywhere on campus for free as long as its not a reserved
or metered stall. There is a [large parking lot][5] to the north of Kelly
Engineering that should have enough room for everyone.

## Sponsorship
