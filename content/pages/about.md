Title: About Beaver Barcamp
Slug: about

Beaver Barcamp is a user-generated conference that started in the spring of
2008 as a bi-annual event at OSU. It has been primarily organized by the [Open
Source Education Lab (OSEL)][1], [OSU Linux Users (OSULUG)][2] group, the [OSU
Open Source Lab (OSUOSL)][3] and Corvallis community members over the years.
Currently the OSUOSL is the primary organizer however still encourage community
involvement.

## What is a Barcamp?

So do barcamps involve Beer? Well no, [barcamps are an international
phoneomon][4] where like-minded people gather to discuss a variety of topics.
Topics often focus more on the web and open source technologies and other
DIY/hacker/open culture themes. Other topics can certainly be non-tech related
and we highly encourage it! 

## Who typically attends?

At Barcamp there, is no specators, only paricipants! Barcamps are only as good
as the people who attend and share their ideas. Attendees are encouraged to
demo new ideas, hold a group discussion on a specific topic, explain a unique
hobby you have or just about anything else.  Sometimes sessions even spawn
other sessions randomly!

We invite everyone and anyone in the community and at OSU to enjoy Beaver Barcamp.
