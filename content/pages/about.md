Title: About Beaver Barcamp
Slug: about

Beaver BarCamp is a user-generated conference that started in the spring of
2008 as a biannual event at Oregon State University. It has been primarily organized by the [Open
Source Education Lab (OSEL)][1], [OSU Linux Users (OSULUG)][2] group, the [OSU
Open Source Lab (OSUOSL)][3] and Corvallis community members over the years.
Currently the OSL is the primary organizer, though we still encourage community
involvement.

## What is a BarCamp?

So do BarCamps involve beer? Well, no. [BarCamps are an international
phenomenon][4] where like-minded people gather to discuss a variety of topics.
Topics often focus more on the Web and open source technologies and other
DIY/hacker/open culture themes. Session topics can certainly be non-tech related as well
and we highly encourage it! 

## Who typically attends?

At BarCamp there are no specators, only paricipants! BarCamps are only as good
as the people who attend and share their ideas. Attendees are encouraged to
demo new ideas, hold a group discussion on a specific topic, explain a unique
hobby or just about anything else. Sometimes sessions even spawn
other sessions randomly!

We invite everyone and anyone in the community and at OSU to enjoy Beaver Barcamp.
