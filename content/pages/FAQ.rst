Who should attend BarCamp?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone -- Beaver BarCamp is open to the community and is free of charge.


How are topics chosen?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most session topics are scheduled the morning of the event and are provided by
the attendees.

What are Lightning Talks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lightning talks are five minute presentations on any topic. At barcamp,
the first session will include lightning talks in the barcamp style;
anyone can sign up beforehand and present on any topic for up to 
five minutes instead of the full hour. We will still have full-length
barcamp talks available during that session, but lightning talks will
be an option.

Who should present?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We welcome presentations of all kinds, and expertise is not required. Come
prepared to share something you are passionate about, whether its your job,
hobby or interests. And formal Powerpoint presentations are not necessary: lead
a discussion, demo a project, play a game, or teach a skill. One of the best
aspects of BarCamp is that attendees both provide the sessions and choose the
schedule, allowing for greater flexibility and fun.


Do I have to present?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nope. You are welcome to participate however you are most comfortable.  Come and
meet new people, learn something new, or participate in a discussion.


What should I bring?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nothing is required, but you may find it convenient to bring a laptop or mobile
device (Wi-Fi is provided), notebook and pen, reusable water bottle, and a
camera.


Do I Need To RSVP?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RSVP is not required, but we would love if you registered for the event on
`EventBrite`_. This helps us plan for enough food and accommodate dietary
restrictions.

Wi-Fi will be available and free to use while at the conference. An account and

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, there will be continental breakfast, lunch and afternoon snack.


Where do I park?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Free parking is widely available on campus on Saturdays, with the
exception of reserved and metered stalls. There is a large parking lot
to the north of Kelly Engineering that should have enough room for
everyone.


What will the session topics be?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At Beaver BarCamp, the majority of sessions are not prearranged. Attendees at
each BarCamp propose their own session ideas on the day of the event, and the
schedules are updated throughout  the day to make sure the most popular sessions
get the largest rooms.


Does BarCamp have something to do with bars and alcohol?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, it doesn't. Its actually a hacker reference to FooBar which is typically
used as a placeholder name when describing something in software code. BarCamp
arose as an open to the public alternative to Foo Camp, which is an
invitation-only conference.
