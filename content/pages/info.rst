WiFi
----

We are using the OSU public wifi system. Look for **OSU_ACCESS** (choose local
DB), account name is **BBC11**, password is **bossyPeccary** (this account
will work only for the weekend).

Restrooms
---------

Are in middle of building, more or less behind the elevator.

Rooms
-----

We are using the conference rooms as well as the small seminar rooms and the
classrooms.  Rooms come in three sizes:

Large (1001, 1003, 1005, 1007):
  Classrooms. Please reserve for very large gatherings. All have projectors.

Medium (1114, 3114, 2057, 3057)
  About 10-20 people.

Even smaller groups (5 or 6 people) can meet in the seats at the end 
of each hall (2nd or 3rd floor) or in the lounge by the south door 
or in the atrium. We have a few student volunteers who can help 
direct you to rooms.


Sessions
--------

Please put a name as presenter/organizer by your topic. If you plan to do a 25
minute session please use a half of a Post-it and claim half of the spot on the
schedule. We are asking that attendees place a sticker (provided at table near
the schedule) on the sessions they think they are going to attend so we can get
an idea of what size room might be needed. Talks that are scheduled in smaller
rooms may be moved into larger rooms in order to accommodate the level of
interest, so watch the board. Similarly, we might combine two similar topics
into one session, or split a session into two.

Always check the board before going to a session to see if the time or room
has changed. You can also check the schedule online here: http://goo.gl/uyaAr

General Rules of conduct
------------------------

Oregon State University has a no alcohol policy for university buildings; it is
also a smoke-free campus. General rules of civilization apply: if you are
inconsiderate, threatening, overbearing or generally rude, you may be asked to
leave.
