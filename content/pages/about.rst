--------------

Beaver BarCamp is an informal conference where everyone is encouraged to
participate and the sessions are not predetermined. It provides a collaborative
environment that promotes the sharing of ideas and projects and is a fun, casual
event filled with discussions, demos and interaction with attendees. One of the
best aspects of BarCamp is that attendees both provide the sessions and choose
the schedule, allowing for greater flexibility and freedom.

What kind of sessions happen at Beaver BarCamp?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All kinds--from the recreational to the technical. While many are tech oriented,
we encourage any DIY, educational or interactive session.

Who typically attends?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We invite everyone and anyone in the community and at OSU to enjoy Beaver
Barcamp. At BarCamp there are no spectators, only participants.  Attendees are
encouraged to demo new ideas, hold a group discussion on a specific topic,
explain a unique hobby or just about anything else.  Sometimes sessions even
spawn other sessions randomly.
