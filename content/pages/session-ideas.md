Title: Session Ideas
Slug: session-ideas

Most sessions do not require prepared slides and we even encourage you not to
use them. We also encourage non-tech sessions and open discussion on a variety of
topics. BarCamp is an excellent way for you to test out your public
speaking skills!

If you know of a session idea you would like to present, please feel free to
submit your idea on the [session idea page][1].

### Here are some session ideas taken from past Beaver BarCamps:
