Title: Session Ideas
Slug: session-ideas

Most sessions do not require prepared slides and we even encourage you not to
use them. We also encourage non-tech sessions and open discussion on a variety of
topics. BarCamp is an excellent way to test out your public
speaking skills.


### Here are some session ideas taken from past Beaver BarCamps:

* Mead Brewing 
* Google App Engine 
* Coffee Q & A: Learn to roast and brew from scratch!
* Discuss Embedded Linux 
* Green Computing: How to go about using thin clients 
* Introduction to the study of Martial Arts 
* Intro to SELinux  
* Let's build a NING website
* Compression Air Vehicles
* OSU Robotics
* Poker Theory & Hold 'em Strategy
* Raspberry Pi: the items, the reasons, the possibilities
* USB Microscope
* Want to try yoga?
