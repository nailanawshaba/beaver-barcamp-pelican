**Do I Need To RSVP?**

* RSVP is not required, but we would love if you registered for the event on 
  [Facebook][3]!

**Wifi?**

* Wifi will be available and free to use while at the conference. An account
  and password will be provided at the event.

<html><!--
* We are using the OSU public wifi system. Look for `OSU_ACCESS` and use account name
 BBC11, password sillyChipmunk (this account will work only for
  the weekend).

**Which rooms do we get at Kelley?**

* The classrooms on the west end, plus all the little conference rooms
  scattered throughout the building. We have a lot of space for discussion.
  This year we're planning on only selecting rooms which are relatively close
  together so that sessions aren't nearly as scattered. If we run out of space
  we'll allocate other room spaces.
  
**Are food and drinks provided?**

* Yes, there will be a modest amount of food and drinks provided in the
  morning, lunch and afternoon break.

**Does BarCamp have something to do with bars and alochol?**

* No, it doesn't. Its actually a hacker reference to [FooBar][1] which is
  typically used as a place holder name when describing something in software
  code. BarCamp arose as an *open to the public alternative* to [Foo Camp][2]
  which is an annual invitation-only event.

**What will the session topics be?**

* Nobody knows yet! Attendees at each BarCamp propose their own session ideas 
  on the day of the event, and the schedules are updated through the day to 
  make sure the most popular sessions get the largest rooms. Check out the 
  [list of past sessions][4] for ideas of what people have spoken about in 
  previous years.
