:summary: Introducing Lightning talks

This year we will be introducing Lightning talks to Beaver Barcamp!
A lightning talk is a five-minute presentation on any given topic; 
it's basically just a shorter version of the usual barcamp talk.  
Instead of a keynote, our first session will be all lightning talks.
You can come early and propose a topic to give a lightning talk on,
or vote on other topics that you want to hear about. The most popular
proposals will be chosen to give their presentations.  If you have
any questions about this format, please email us at info<at>osuosl.org!
We look forward to seeing you at Beaver Barcamp 15!
