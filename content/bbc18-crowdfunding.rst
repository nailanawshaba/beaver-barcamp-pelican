:summary: BBC18 crowdfunding announcement

Beaver BarCamp is scheduled for Saturday, April 7, 2018 and we hope to
see you there! Previously the Open Source Lab has been able to fully
fund the event, but this year it is difficult for us to fund it due
to some budget constraints. The even is still happening, but we need
help funding things like free t-shirts, food, and drinks. To cover the
cost of those items we need to raise $4,000. If you would like to help
us raise money to make BarCamp that much better, check out our
`Beaver BarCamp 2018 crowdfunding site`_ which inludes the areas where
we need donations. Please do what you can to keep BarCamp going!
